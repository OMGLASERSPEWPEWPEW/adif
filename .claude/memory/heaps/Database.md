**assistant**: The `buzzing-skipping-koala.md` was the most recent one, from the EQMacEmu login fix — but that's an old issue. Let me look at the earlier session's journal more carefully. That session had an agent that did extensive reading and then wrote something. Let me check the later part of that journal.

**assistant**: [tool: Read]

**assistant**: I see Writes near the end of the session (15:29). Those look like they wrote memory files and updated the memory index. But then at the very end at 15:30-15:33 there were git commits happening. And earlier around 11:34-11:38 there was a burst of ~14 Write calls — that's likely where the document was created. Let me search for recently created files outside of reference/.

But you said "documentation on work left to be done" — let me look more carefully. The session also had a Write at 11:15 and around 11:34-11:38 that created migration files 009-022. And there were Writes at 15:29 updating memory. But you said "a few minutes ago" which would mean this current session or very close to it.

**user**: morning. Last night we made a doc that tracks all the mysql statements we have to convert. Can you find it? Also do we have any unstaged work?

**ZEPHYR RECAP**

The big headline: **you got PostgreSQL-backed EQEmu to boot and reach character select last night.** That's a real milestone. Login works, the server connects to PG on port 5433, and you proved the concept. Character creation is where it currently breaks — the C++ expects `character_data` with 106 columns and we only have 51, plus 9 tables are under different names and ~146 tables are flat-out missing.

The doc you made last night is **`docs/postgresql-migration-map.md`*...

**user**: Ok thank you. Let's talk about the migration map. What are we actually doing. Are we creating a view or are we changing the server's hardcoded mysql statements to postgres?

**assistant**: Both, actually — but at different layers.

**The database side** is mostly done. We've created ~129 PostgreSQL tables via migration files in `database/migrations/`. The remaining work there is the 146 missing tables and 9 name mismatches (like `zones` vs `zone`, `spells` vs `spells_new`). For the name mismatches, the simplest fix is just renaming our PG tables to match what the C++ expects — no views needed.

**The C++ side** is the bigger beast. The EQEmu server code at `reference/eqemu-ser...

**assistant**: [tool: Read]

**assistant**: All conversions look correct:

- **UNIX_TIMESTAMP** → `EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM suspendeduntil)::int` (line 123)
- **FROM_UNIXTIME** → `TO_TIMESTAMP(...)` (line 306)
- **Backtick `class`** → `"class"` with PG double-quote quoting (line 169)
- **REPLACE INTO** → `INSERT INTO ... ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE SET` (verified earlier)

Now let me update the migration map to track this progress.

**assistant**: [tool: Read]

**assistant**: [tool: Edit]

**assistant**: Phase 1 is complete. Here's the summary:

**244 base repository files converted to native PostgreSQL:**
- 244 `REPLACE INTO` → `INSERT INTO ... ON CONFLICT (pk) DO UPDATE SET`
- 270 `FROM_UNIXTIME()` → `TO_TIMESTAMP()`
- 54 `UNIX_TIMESTAMP()` → `EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ...)::int`
- 40 backtick identifiers → PostgreSQL double-quote identifiers
- `BaseUpsertSet()` method added to all 244 files for the ON CONFLICT SET clause

6 files were untouched (no MySQL-isms): bot_group_members, bot_groups,...
