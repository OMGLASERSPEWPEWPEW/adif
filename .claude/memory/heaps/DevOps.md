## Done

**Agent config pre-filled** (placeholders gone — verified 0 remaining):
- `zephyr/agent.md` — lead orchestrator now knows: ADIF / EverQuest-like MMORPG, stack TBD, Phase 0 pre-production, points at the reference codebase.
- `Theia/agent.md` — draft brand identity (essence "Endless worlds, lasting bonds," voice, a fantasy color/font palette, and a terminology glossary). **These are first-draft values flagged for you to refine** — colors and fonts are placeholders....

unnote it. This is a private passion project not a business.  getting the assets and stuff can't be wrong if twenty emulators haev it. We'll replace the assets but we need to get the game running first

**assistant**: Fair — it's your private project, and I overweighted the legal framing. Toning it down. One quick factual correction though, because it actually helps the "get it running" goal:

Emulators don't ship the assets precisely *because* redistribution isn't theirs to do — so every emulator setup has each user **supply their own client files**. "Twenty emulators have it" really means twenty users each brought their own copy. So the practical path to a running server is: grab the matching client yoursel...

**assistant**: **Phase 2: ANALYZE**

Here's what I see:

| File | Nature |
|------|--------|
| `docs/postgresql-migration-map.md` | New migration tracking doc |
| `.claude/hooks/session-journal.sh` + `.claude/settings.json` | Fix hook paths to use absolute paths (same fix) |
| `.claude/bridge-journal.md`, `.claude/journals/*`, `.claude/memory/daily/*`, `.claude/memory/heaps/*` | Auto-generated session/memory tracking |
| `du.exe.stackdump` | Crash dump — **exclude** (shouldn't be committed) |

- `25f71a4` fix(infra): use absolute paths for session-journal hook
- `d975e43` chore(infra): add bridge journal, session journals, and memory heaps

Only `du.exe.stackdump` remains in the working tree (untracked) — you can delete it or add it to `.gitignore` whenever.

**user**: Ok thank you. Let's talk about the migration map. What are we actually doing. Are we creating a view or are we changing the server's hardcoded mysql statements to postgres?

**assistant**: Both, actually — but at different layers.

**The database side** is mostly done. We've created ~129 PostgreSQL tables via migration files in `database/migrations/`. The remaining work there is the 146 missing tables and 9 name mismatches (like `zones` vs `zone`, `spells` vs `spells_new`). For the name mismatches, the simplest fix is just renaming our PG tables to match what the C++ expects — no views needed.

**The C++ side** is the bigger beast. The EQEmu server code at `reference/eqemu-ser...

**assistant**: [tool: Read]

**assistant**: All conversions look correct:

- **UNIX_TIMESTAMP** → `EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM suspendeduntil)::int` (line 123)
- **FROM_UNIXTIME** → `TO_TIMESTAMP(...)` (line 306)
- **Backtick `class`** → `"class"` with PG double-quote quoting (line 169)
- **REPLACE INTO** → `INSERT INTO ... ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE SET` (verified earlier)

Now let me update the migration map to track this progress.

**assistant**: [tool: Read]

**assistant**: [tool: Edit]

**assistant**: Phase 1 is complete. Here's the summary:

**244 base repository files converted to native PostgreSQL:**
- 244 `REPLACE INTO` → `INSERT INTO ... ON CONFLICT (pk) DO UPDATE SET`
- 270 `FROM_UNIXTIME()` → `TO_TIMESTAMP()`
- 54 `UNIX_TIMESTAMP()` → `EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ...)::int`
- 40 backtick identifiers → PostgreSQL double-quote identifiers
- `BaseUpsertSet()` method added to all 244 files for the ON CONFLICT SET clause

6 files were untouched (no MySQL-isms): bot_group_members, bot_groups,...
