## ZEPHYR RECAP

**The big picture: you've been on a MySQL-to-PostgreSQL conversion marathon for the EQEmu reference server, and you're tantalizingly close to zoning in.**

Over the last 3 sessions (June 21-23), you went from a crash-looping MariaDB to a fully PostgreSQL-backed EQEmu server. The arc:

1. **June 21** — Fixed MariaDB, stood up PG-backed server, got to character select for the first time on PostgreSQL. Hit a wall of missing/mismatched table schemas.

2. **June 22** — The big one. Converted **290+ C++ source files** from MySQL SQL to native PostgreSQL. Bulk conversion script for 250 base repos, manual work on 27 custom repos, parallel agents on zone/world files. Gutted the `RewriteQuery()` runtime shim. First successful server boot on PG — 618 zones loaded.

3. **June 23** — Applied migrations 030-034, fixed 13 blockers (name rejection, column mismatches, missing tables, quest plugin stubs). **Character creation works. Zone boots with maps/water/navmesh.** But zone entry itself times out — the last blocker is **ON CONFLICT composite PK mismatches** in character_bind, character_skills, character_languages, and rule_values. The C++ uses `ON CONFLICT (id)` but these tables have composite PKs like `(id, slot)`.

**What's still broken (documented in `docs/postgresql-errors-inventory.md`):**
- 5 ON CONFLICT composite PK fixes needed in C++ custom repos
- 5 column name mismatches to fix
- 3 missing tables (spawn2_disabled, global_loot, ldon_trap_*)
- 8 hardcoded MySQL syntax remnants in C++ (backticks, REGEXP, LIMIT)
- ~25 non-fatal missing tables (Tier 2 gameplay systems)

**None of these changes are committed** — the migrations (030-034), C++ edits, quest stubs, and DB triggers are all uncommitted. That's a lot of work sitting in the working tree.

**The immediate next step** per the bridge journal: fix those ON CONFLICT composite PK targets in the C++ custom repos, rebuild, and test zone entry end-to-end. That's the last gate before you can...

# /c&p — Commit and Push

Group changes into logical commits with machine-readable messages, then push.

## Commit Convention

### Message format

```
type(scope): imperative summary (72 chars max)

Why: one or two sentences explaining reasoning, not the diff
Files: key-file-1.ts, key-file-2.ts, key-file-3.ts

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

**Rules:**
- Summary: imperative mood ("Add", "Fix", "Extract" — not "Added", "Fixing"), 72 chars max
- `Why:` trailer: required for all types except `chore` and `docs`
- `Files:` trailer: required, list the 2-5 most significant files touched
- `Co-Authored-By:` footer: always present
- Multi-scope: if genuinely equal, list both: `feat(palette,shared): extract helper`

### Exempt types

`Evolve:` and `Promote:` are ritual commit types produced by `/evolution` and `/promote`. They use their own format. **Never rewrite, absorb, or duplicate these.** If detected in today's git log, exclude their files from grouping.

### Change types

| Type | When to use | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| `feat` | New user-facing capability | `feat(palette): add per-pane model selection` |
| `fix` | Corrects a bug | `fix(agendas): prevent stale cache on day rollover` |
| `refactor` | Restructuring without behavior change | `refactor(palette): extract pane registry` |

**assistant**: [tools: Bash, Bash]

**assistant**: Good. Now I have the full picture. Here's the analysis:

---

**Proposed commits (4):**

**1. `feat(database): add migrations 030-034 for EQEmu PostgreSQL schema alignment`**

Why: Character creation and zone boot required 9 table renames, 30+ missing tables, and dozens of column fixes to align ADIF's PostgreSQL schema with EQEmu's C++ expectations.
Files: database/migrations/030-034_*.sql

**2. `docs(database): add PostgreSQL migration error inventory`**

Files: docs/postgresql-errors-inventory.md

**3. `fix(infra): improve conversation logger with tool collapsing and system-reminder stripping`**

Why: Daily logs were bloated with raw system-reminder XML and individual tool-use lines; collapsing consecutive tools and stripping reminders makes logs readable.
Files: .claude/hooks/conversation-logger.sh

**4. `chore(infra): update session journals, memory heaps, and bridge journal`**

Files: .claude/bridge-journal.md, .claude/journals/*, .claude/memory/*

**Excluded:**
- `du.exe.stackdump` — crash dump, should not be committed
- `database/.claude/journals/` — session journal that ended up in the wrong place, should not be committed

Proceed? [yes / edit N / skip N / abort]

**assistant**: All clean. 4 commits pushed to main:

1. `18f51b9` **feat(database):** migrations 030-034 for EQEmu PostgreSQL schema alignment (1,101 lines)
2. `02cea27` **docs(database):** PostgreSQL migration error inventory
3. `60b6d63` **fix(infra):** conversation logger tool collapsing + system-reminder stripping
4. `c130bb1` **chore(infra):** session journals, memory heaps, bridge journal

Left uncommitted (intentionally): `du.exe.stackdump` and `database/.claude/` — neither belongs in the repo.

## 2026-06-25_08-11-29 (session 8906d434)

**assistant**: [tools: Bash]

**assistant**: [tools: Bash]

**assistant**: [tools: Grep]

**assistant**: Got the creds. Let me pull the starting_items data and the PG table state.

**assistant**: [tools: Bash, Bash]

**assistant**: [tools: Bash]

**assistant**: [tools: Bash]

**assistant**: There it is. Crystal clear now:

- **MariaDB**: 148 rows of starting items data, correct column names (`class_list`, `race_list`, `inventory_slot`, etc.)
- **PostgreSQL**: 0 rows, and has BOTH old columns (`race`, `class`, `deityid`, `zoneid`, `slot`, `gm`) AND new columns (added by migration 033) — a messy hybrid

Let me dump the MariaDB data and load it into PG.

**assistant**: [tools: Bash]

**assistant**: Got all 148 rows. Now I'll write a migration that fixes the PG table schema (drops the old columns, keeps the correct ones) and inserts all the data.

**assistant**: [tools: Bash]

**assistant**: [tools: Glob, Glob]

**assistant**: [tools: Read]

**assistant**: I'll create migration 036 to fix the schema and load all 148 starting items.

**assistant**: [tools: Write]

**assistant**: Now let me apply it.

**assistant**: [tools: Bash]

**assistant**: Let me verify it looks right.

**assistant**: [tools: Bash, Bash]

**assistant**: Clean. The table now has:
- **19 columns** matching exactly what the C++ repository expects (old cruft columns `race`, `class`, `deityid`, `zoneid`, `gm`, `slot` are gone)
- **148 rows** of PEQ starting item data — weapons, armor, food, spell components per race/class/deity/zone combo

The column order in PG doesn't match the C++ `Columns()` order perfectly, but that doesn't matter — the C++ selects columns by name via `SelectColumnsRaw()`, not by position.

Characters should now spawn with their proper starting gear instead of naked. Want to fire up the servers and test a character creation?

# /bridge — Founder's Bridge Journal

Append the user's message as a timestamped entry to `.claude/bridge-journal.md`, along with auto-gathered session context.

## What this is

The Bridge Journal is **the captain's voice** — not Claude's, not any agent's. It captures the user's thinking, priorities, frustrations, and decisions in their own words. Every agent reads it at session start as the highest-context source of truth. Each entry also carries auto-gathered session context (git history, conversation summary) so future agents understand what was happening when the captain spoke.

## Execution

1. Take the user's message (everything after `/bridge`)
2. Get the current timestamp in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format
3. **Gather git context:**
   - Read `.claude/bridge-journal.md` and find the most recent `### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` header
   - Run `git log --since="<last entry timestamp>" --oneline -20` (fall back to `--since="midnight"` if no prior entries)
   - Run `git diff --stat HEAD~10..HEAD`
4. **Summarize the conversation:**
   - Review the current conversation and distill 2-4 bullet points covering: what was built/fixed, key decisions, notable problems solved
   - Keep each bullet under 15 words
   - Omit this section entirely if the conversation was trivial (no substantive work before `/bridge`)
5. **Assemble the entry** using this format:

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM

<user's message, verbatim>

> **Session context** *(auto-gathered)*
>
> **What happened:**
> - Built X with Y approach
> - Fixed Z caused by W
> - Decided to defer Q until next phase
>
> **Commits since last entry:**
> ```
> abc1234 feat(scope): short description
> def5678 fix(scope): another description
> ```
>
> **Files touched:**
> ```
> src/foo/bar.ts  | 42 +++--
> src/baz/qux.tsx | 28 ++-
> ```
```

6. Append to `.claude/bridge-journal.md`
7. Confirm with a single line: "Logged to the Bridge Journal."

**assistant**: [tools: Read]

**assistant**: Now let me write the updated error inventory with all the new errors from the zone boot log.

**assistant**: [tools: Write]

**assistant**: Error inventory updated. Here's the summary:

**Remaining work to clear all errors:**
- **22 missing tables** (mostly character subsystems: bandolier, potionbelt, disciplines, tasks, keyring, etc.)
- **12 column mismatches** (missing columns like `augslot1-6`, `close_timer_ms`, `taunting`; renamed columns like `slot` vs `slot_id`)
- **4 raw SQL column name mismatches** in C++ code (`charID` vs `char_id`, `p_accid` vs `accid`)
- **1 ON CONFLICT issue** on inventory table
- **1 reserved word** (`end` in base_data needs quoting)
- **4 uncommitted C++ fixes** from this session
